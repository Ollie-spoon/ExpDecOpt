    "This file contains optimization code to fit a series of multi-exponential decays to patient data our NMR scans of the patient's skeletal muscles. It is designed so that you should be able to run every block in succession after the initial function imports so that functions don't need to be recompiled.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core ideas in the optimization process used are that newton/quasi-newton optimisation methods work really well for exponential decay fitting due to their ability to cope with wide trough-like loss landscapes. e.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "    f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2/1000\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is an issue here because newton methods are local rather than global, so we're using a sampling method to sample starting points. To do this, we start with one decay, where the loss landscape typically only has a single minimum and then use the results of the mono-exponential decay fitting to produce a number of candidate starting points for two decays. We then repeat this process for three decays using the information from the bi-exponential best fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The specific optimization algorithm used is BFGS - a quasi-newton method. In theory it is not as effective as the pure newton method in certain circumstances, however, it is more robust to starting conditions so we're using it for the moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The essence of this local sampling method is that by sampling enough points to perform local optimziations from, we should always be able to find a global minimum. I will also note here that due to the physical nature of our measurements we know that all amplitudes and decay constants must be positive by definition."
